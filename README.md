## Treasure Island

# Instructions

Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program.

# Extensions

Have a think about how you might write your program to make a player's answers less case-sensitive. In other words, your code should work regardless of whether your user answers "left" or "Left".

[You can also add your own ASCII art](https://ascii.co.uk/art). Just remember to add three single quotes `'''` at the start and at the end of your artwork to turn it into a multi-line string.
